<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ageproR is a R-package designed to handle input data to and from Jon Brodizak's 
AGEPRO (Age Structured Projection Model). 

## Note

**ageproR** is still in development. These features will be implemented in future updates. 

- Predictor Recruitment Models 
- Fixed Recruitment Model 
- Empirical Cumulative Distrubutuion Factor for w/ Linear Decline to Zero
- Markov Matrix Recruitment Model
- Run AGEPRO models with Jon Brodziak's AGEPRO calculation engine within R.

Importing Stock Synthesis report data as AGEPRO input data is being developed as a separate R-package: ss3agepro


**If you using AGEPRO for production, please use:**

- [Jon Brodziak's original AGEPRO program (source code)](https://github.com/PIFSCstockassessments/AGEPRO)
- [GUI interface for AGEPRO (installer & source)](https://github.com/PIFSCstockassessments/AGEPRO-GUI)

## Installation

You can install the development version of ageproR from 
[PIFSCstockassessments GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PIFSCstockassessments/ageproR) 
with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# via `pak`
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("PIFSCstockassessments/ageproR")

# alternative\legacy method
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PIFSCstockassessments/ageproR")
```

## AGEPRO input file format

**ageproR** is compatible with the AGEPRO input file formats 
`AGEPRO VERSION 4.0` & `AGEPRO VERSION 4.25`. By default, **ageproR** writes
to the `AGEPRO VERSION 4.0` Input File Format.

Please refer to the *AGEPRO Reference Manual* for more technical details.
